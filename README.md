# bitbar_vultr
A simple little PHP script that uses the Vultr API to present a list of your VMs, along with their IP addresses and some other useful information. 

Installation (BitBar):

```
cp vultr.5m.php ~/Documents/BitBar/
chmod +x ~/Documents/BitBar/vultr.5m.php
```

Installation (Argos):

```
cp vultr.5m.php ~/.config/argos/
chmod +x ~/.config/argos/vultr.5m.php
```

Once you've copied the script to the correct location, make sure you edit *the copied* script and change YOURAPITOKEN to whatever your Vultr API token actually is.
